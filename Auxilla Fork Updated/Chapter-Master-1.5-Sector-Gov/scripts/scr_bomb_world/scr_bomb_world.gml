// Bombardment tuning. These govern how much of a world a single bombardment kills.
// Casualties are a share of the world's population CAPACITY (its max population) so a
// world is depopulated down to zero over repeated strikes rather than a fixed absolute
// figure that wipes small worlds in one shot. The share scales with how much fleet
// firepower is committed and is shaped by world type, enemy size, how far the enemy has
// overrun the world, and the world's fortifications. Bombardment never turns a world
// Dead; the world keeps its type at zero population and can regrow once its enemies are
// cleared. All values are macros so balance can be tuned without touching logic.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Share of world capacity killed per point of bombard score, before the factor
// multipliers. Bombard score is Battle Barge 3, Strike Cruiser 1, escorts 0, so more
// ships (and bigger ships) do more population damage. Zero ships do nothing.
#macro BOMBARD_POP_PER_POWER 0.06
// Hard ceiling on a single bombard's share of capacity. At 1.0 an overwhelming fleet can
// depopulate a world in one strike; a lone ship takes many.
#macro BOMBARD_MAX_FRACTION 1.0
// Each fortification level (0 none .. 5 fully fortified) cuts population casualties by
// this much, down to the floor, since bunkers and shelters protect civilians.
